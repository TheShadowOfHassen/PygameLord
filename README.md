This is a library of reusable code fragments, put into a module form. 
See the scrapbook folder for non module reusable code.
They are licensed under the MIT license so feel free to put it in any of your projects even your closed source ones!

There is also a module in pypi that you can call for the parts that can be called as a module. Install it using: pip install PygameLord

However, you might be better off downloading this repository and using just what's needed.

Feel free to contribute your own stuff.
