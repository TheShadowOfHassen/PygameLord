PygameLord (Library Of Reusible Doohickeys)
Copyright 2022 Nathanaek K. Stottlemyer

This is a library of reuisble code fragments, put into a module form. 
See the scrapbook folder for non module reusible fabrics.
They are lisensed under the MIT lisense so feel free to put it in any of your projects even your comerical ones!

Feel free to contribute your own stuff. I hope eventually to make this huge and maybe even include frameworks for games.
